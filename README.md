# FlagJudge

Code in, flag out. The poorest online judge for use with CTF-like contests.

WIP.

## Why the name

1. This is for use with CTFs.
2. Shitcoded. Vulnerable. Don't hide flags in the codebase. Others will find them out.

## License

[GLWTPL](./GLWTPL). Good luck.

Also dual licensed under [UNLICENSE](./UNLICENSE) if you need a OSI-approved public domain license.
